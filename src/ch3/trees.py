# Nope, that didn't work either. Consider the list 5,6,1,2,3,4. 5 might check out, 6 wouldn't, and now we might be looking at a sort problem of nlgn
# New new idea. What if for every node, we check it against its parent AND children? Might not work, recursion would fall apart when looking at a 
# child that assumes its parent is a good person. Each node has to look its entire branch maybe? That would be nlgn though, not n. HMMM.

# I think the key is that I need to specifically be looking for just two. Looking for all is definitely not an O(n) problem. Let's go back
# to my last attempt. If I do a findmin on the list, O(n), I can do two sets of ops. First I loop and look for anything greater than min
# at the beginning of the list. Once I get to min, then I just need to check that every element is less than the next element, ignoring last element


# Going back and finishing that idea was still fruitless. Something I didn't consider is that 5,6,1,2,3,4 is an invalid list for SWAP 2. That is indeed
# a key requirement of this problem. Let's build a set of example lists that are VALID, meaning only 2 nodes are out of position. In that last list, the whole
# dang thing is a problem.

# 2,1 (swap 1 and 2)
# 1,3,2 (swap 2 and 3)
# 3,2,1 (swap 1 and 3)
# 1,4,3,2 (4 & 2)
# 4,2,3,1 (1 & 4)
# 1,2,5,4,3,6 (3 & 5)

# Given this set, let's find the pattern. The two nodes we're looking for appear to always be:
# 1) the first node greater than the next node
# 2) the last node less than the previous node (the first node less than will be the one immediately after step 1, but we could find another later in the list)
# If this holds, then we were off to a good start by traversing and creating a list. We fell off track with the algorithm that then stepped through that list.
# Let's try again!
